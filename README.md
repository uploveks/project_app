## Project Description
The goal of this project is to solve the N Queens problem using a serial algorithm, followed by parallelizing it using parallel processing techniques (MPI and OMP). The N Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The solution will be evaluated on multiple problem sizes, and to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance, the application will be profiled.

## Algorithm Complexity
The serial algorithm used to solve the N Queens problem has an exponential complexity O(N!), as it must check all possible permutations of the queens on the chessboard to find a valid solution. However, by using optimizations (checking the safety of each position), performance can be significantly improved, but the complexity remains exponential.

## Execution Times for Each Problem Size
The algorithm was tested on three datasets corresponding to different N values:

- **Small**: N=14 (Execution Time: 0.013420000 seconds)
- **Medium**: N=15 (Execution Time: 2.687432000  seconds)
- **Big**: N=16 (Execution Time: 18.519619000 seconds)

  These times were obtained by running the algorithm in a serial implementation, demonstrating how execution time increases significantly with larger values of N due to the exponential complexity of the problem. 


## Profiling and Bottlenecks

Profiling was conducted using **Intel VTune** to identify major bottlenecks and evaluate each algorithm's performance.
